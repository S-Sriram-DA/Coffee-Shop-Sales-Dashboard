# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard

## 📌 Problem Statement
A coffee shop chain needed an interactive dashboard to track daily sales, customer preferences, and revenue trends to make better staffing and product decisions.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI (visualization & reporting)  
- Excel (data cleaning & aggregation)

## 🔄 Approach
1. Cleaned and prepared raw transactions in Excel (dedupe, timestamp parsing, category mapping).  
2. Imported cleaned data to Power BI and created a star-schema for reporting.  
3. Built interactive visuals: KPIs (Total Sales, Avg Bill), Time-series trends, Product mix, Top locations, and Peak hours.  
4. Added slicers for location, date range, and category to support ad-hoc analysis.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Peak sales hours: **8:00–10:00 AM** (morning rush) — suggests adjusting staff scheduling.  
- Seasonal spike in Q4: **~25%** increase in seasonal beverage sales.  
- Top 3 products contributed **~45%** of total revenue.
