# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard

## 📌 Problem Statement
A coffee shop chain needed an interactive dashboard to track daily sales, customer preferences, and revenue trends to make better staffing and product decisions.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI (visualization & reporting)  
- Excel (data cleaning & aggregation)

## 🔄 Approach
1. Cleaned and prepared raw transactions in Excel (dedupe, timestamp parsing, category mapping).  
2. Imported cleaned data to Power BI and created a star-schema for reporting.  
3. Built interactive visuals: KPIs (Total Sales, Avg Bill), Time-series trends, Product mix, Top locations, and Peak hours.  
4. Added slicers for location, date range, and category to support ad-hoc analysis.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Peak sales hours: **8:00–10:00 AM** (morning rush) — suggests adjusting staff scheduling.
- Weekend sales were consistently higher than weekdays, suggesting opportunities for promotions on Saturdays and Sundays.
- Bottom 3 products generated less than 5% of sales. → Suggest either stopping production or running targeted promotions/discounts to improve their performance.
